# Starter API Project
This project is here to help out as a starting point for developers who are not familiar with .NET

It is a basic API project that partialy implements some of the desired features of the coding challenge.

Some features are mostly implemented while others are left to the coder
to finish.  Part of the API will run properly and it is expected that the patient specific part will not, and should be completed by the interviewee.
